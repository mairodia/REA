			<h1>Welcome to the Real Estate Association</h1>
			<h2>Where future professionals thrive</h2>
			<br>
			<h4>Meetings every Thursday during U-Hour (12 - 1PM) in building 163-2020</h4>

			<p>The vision of the Cal Poly Real Estate Association is to serve as an active, well respected hub of students, faculty, alumni and professionals who are committed to furthering the quality of real estate education. The organization creates learning and networking opportunities that help students prepare for careers in the real estate industry and provides a strong business network for industry participants.</p>
			<br>

			<br>
			<p>For the year of 2017-2018 we have brought the Argus Software Program to students. We have had over a dozen well-established professionals as guest speakers and mentors for our program. REA has acquired 23 new members since last year and plans to do field trips to the headquarters of leading real estate businesses such as CBRE and the Irvine Company. We are also planning to bring students on tours to development sites. Students that participated in REA have had a higher rate of employment within the real estate industry.</p>
			<br>
			<hr>
			<br>
			<p>Our goals for next year are to have more students involved in REA activities, go on more field trips, and have students participate in professional organizations such as NAIOP, the Urban Land Institute, and the Appraisal Institute. We also hope to be able to form a team and compete in the 2019 NAIOP Challenge.</p>
